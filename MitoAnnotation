__MitoFish__ is a mitochondiral genome database of fish

Why you would use this:
* you are interested in fish species/taxonomy
* have fish mitochondrial sequences to BLAST 
* sequenced fish mitogenomes and need to annotate them
* need to do comparative genomics 
* analyze fish environmental DNA 



__MitoAnnotator__
* annotates fish mitogenomes fast and accurately
*Input: Mitogenome file in FASTA format
  * If downloading files from NCBI to annotate they give you an *.fna file which MitoAnnotator can't recognize
  * Solution: Change the file extenstion 
        * cp *.fna *.fasta
* Note whether your genome is circular (complete) and if you want visualization 
  * MitoAnnotator automatically finds tRNAPhe gene and adjusts the coordinates so that its first portion contains the tRNAPhe gene. If not applicable say genome is not circular

*Output: Annotation files and annotation visualization
