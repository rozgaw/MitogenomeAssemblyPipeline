BLAST alignment to compare similarity between SMART2 mitogenome assembly and the mitogenome assembly generated from GetOrganelle
To compare genome sequences:

* Check the box next to __Align two or more sequences__ under the Query Sequence box
* Blast SMART2 assembled mitogenome against our GetOrganelle assembled mitogenome
* Name job title and blast the sequences against each other
* Two results:

  * Query sequence (SMART2 assembly) compared to subject sequence (GetOrganelle) and shows similarity
  * How the sequences differ (if they differ at all)
      * Go to the __Alignments tab__ and in the __Alignment view__ drop-down menu select __Pairwise with dots for identities__

      * Click the checkbox next to __CDS feature__
        * First result shows base-by-base comparison of the two sequences in two lines
