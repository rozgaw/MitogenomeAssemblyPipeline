Over the course of the past few weeeks, I have made progress in getting fastp to appropriately trim each of the fastq files generated prior. These fastq files were then inputted into GetOrganelle's default animal mitogenome assembly recipe

However, Hailey's BLAST+ of the assembly made using the seed sequence from the study was 99% identical to the assembly produced in the study. Because of this, we have opted to avoid using the default recipe.

This week, we worked on the App Note Rough Draft together, and have begun plans for finalizing the wrapper script to streamline fastq file processing, reading, assembly, and visualization.
