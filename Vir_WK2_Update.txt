This week, we primarily focused on developing a proper action plan for how we want to move forward. As of right now, our plan is to replicate the study given to us by Dr. Stuart.

We are also looking into mitogenome specific options for SPades. The advantage of switching to SPades is being able to perform all analysis through one pipeline instead of having to generate and download output to be used on a web browser for SMART2.

Regarding personal progress this week, I have edited the README file to include more precise instruction on replicating the extent of analysis we have covered thus far. Additionally, I have generated te fastq files using fastq-dump from the SRA file downloaded from NCBI. I wanted to run fastqc, but as of right now, do not have it installed, nor am I granted permission to install it on the server.

Moving forward, I'd like to complete the SMART2 analysis and work on a wrapper script to execute all of the file preparation and alignment leading up to SMART2 or SPades analysis.
