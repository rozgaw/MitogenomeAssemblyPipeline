# Once getOrganelle is run in one of 4 ways, we will run Bowtie2 to compare the getOrganelle assembly to the assembly from the paper (GenBank accession ON310810)
# 4 options:
        # GetOrganelle using animal_mt seed with fastp adaptor and quality trimmed sequences
        # GetOrganelle using animal_mt seed with fastp adaptor and no quality trimmed sequences
        # GetOrganelle using fish cyt_b seed with fastp adaptor and quality trimmed sequences
        # GetOrganelle using fish cyt_b seed with fastp adaptor and no quality trimmed sequences

# Download the assembled mitogenome from gen bank (I renamed to ACaliMitoG.fasta)
# Upload file to server in GetOrganelle output folder and make sure you are in that directory

# Build Bowtie Index: bowtie2-build fasta_file index_name
bowtie2-build ACaliMitoG.fasta ACali

# Running Bowtie2: bowtie2 --quiet -x EcoliK12 -1 GetOrganelleOutput_1.fastq -2 GetOrganelleOutput_2.fastq -S OutfileName.sam
# can use nohup also
nohup bowtie2 --quiet -x ACali -1 1-out.SRR18689888_1.fastq -2 2-out.SRR18689888_2.fastq -S AssemblyComp.sam

# Actually running Blast instead...
        # Blast our assembly against the published assembly
